### 1. To see documentation open _docs/html/index.html_
### 2. To compile with CMake use **CMakeLists.txt** and commands (versions of compilers was given to my e-mail):
        2.1  go to _/build_ directory
        2.2. cmake <special keys eg. compiler settings> <path to /build florder>
        2.3. make
        2.4. run compiled file!
        
### 3. Directories:
        3.1. src - source code
        3.2. libs - headers and ext. libs
        3.3. docs - documentation
